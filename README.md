## Solidity Smart Contract -- Prediction.Sol

The smart contract is designed to handle betting on two outcomes (Team A and Team B). Its versatile design enables applicability to any event characterized by binary outcomesâ€”be it coin flips, sporting events, stock market fluctuations, and the like. The admin can open or close betting, decide the outcome of the bet based on real world result, and, if necessary (such as in the event of a game suspension), withdraw funds from the contract. Players can place bets, and claim their winnings once the outcome is decided.

### Main Functions

- `toggleBetting(true for open)`: Admin can open or close betting.
- `placeBet(true for TeamA)`: Place a bet on Team A or Team B. The function is payable, meaning it requires sending ETH along with the transaction.
- `withdraw(uint256 amount)`: Admin can withdraw ETH from the contract.
- `decideOutcome(true for teamA Won)`: Admin can decide the outcome of the bet.
- `claimWinnings()`: Players can claim their winnings based on the outcome and their bet.

### View Functions
- `getTotalBets()`: View function to get the total bets placed on Team A and Team B.
- `getBetDetails(address bettor)`: View function to get the bet details of a specific player.
- `getOutcome()`: View function to get the current outcome of the bet.
- `getAdmins()`: View function to get the admin and fee recipient addresses.
